COMPARTMENTS:
  N1 = Deep venous system (femoral vein, popliteal vein, deep veins)
  N2 = Saphenous trunk (GSV = Great Saphenous Vein, SSV = Small Saphenous Vein)
  N3 = Tributaries, perforators branching off the saphenous trunk, varicosities, superficial branches

FLOW DIRECTIONS:
  EP = Antegrade (forward, physiological, normal direction toward heart)
  RP = Retrograde (reflux, backward, pathological, away from heart)

POSITION RATIOS (posYRatio — 0 = groin, 1 = ankle):
  SFJ / groin area:           0.04 – 0.09
  Upper thigh:                0.10 – 0.20
  Mid thigh (Hunterian area): 0.21 – 0.35
  Knee / popliteal area:      0.40 – 0.55
  Calf:                       0.60 – 0.80
  Ankle:                      0.85 – 1.00

KEY MAPPINGS FROM CLINICAL LANGUAGE:
  "SFJ incompetent" / "reflux at SFJ" / "deep blood enters GSV at groin"
      → EP  N1→N2  posYRatio≈0.06

  "GSV reflux" / "blood flows backward in GSV" / "GSV carries reflux downward"
      → RP  N2→N1  (at the level described, e.g. mid-thigh ≈ 0.30)

  "blood escapes to tributaries" / "GSV feeds tributaries" / "EP from GSV to branch"
      → EP  N2→N3  (at the level described)

  "blood refluxes back in the tributary" / "tributary drains backward"
      → RP  N3→N2 or RP N3→N1  (depending on where it drains to)

  "perforator feeds GSV" / "there is a perforator entry into the trunk"
      → EP  N2→N2  (perforator entry — note: fromType=N2, toType=N2, NOT N1→N2)
      This means SFJ is COMPETENT even if posYRatio is small.

  "deep vein directly feeds a tributary" / "N1 to N3 direct connection"
      → EP  N1→N3

  "Hunterian perforator incompetent" / "mid-thigh perforator entry from deep system"
      → EP  N1→N2  posYRatio≈0.25 (SFJ INCOMPETENT via Hunterian)

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
  - EP N1→N2 means deep system → saphenous trunk (SFJ or Hunterian INCOMPETENT)
  - EP N2→N2 means perforator → saphenous trunk (SFJ COMPETENT)
  - RP N2→N1 means saphenous trunk reflux (backward in GSV)
  - RP N3→N2 means tributary reflux back into GSV
  - RP N3→N1 means tributary reflux all the way back to deep system

=== CLINICAL DESCRIPTION TO INTERPRET ===
{description}

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Read the description carefully.
2. Identify each distinct blood flow event mentioned.
3. Generate one virtual clip per flow event.
4. Use the mappings above to assign EP/RP and N1/N2/N3 notation.
5. Estimate posYRatio from anatomical location clues.
6. If left/right leg is mentioned, assign legSide accordingly (default: "Left").
7. If the description is NOT about patient venous anatomy (e.g., it is a question,
   a greeting, or asks about a concept without describing a patient), set is_clinical=false.
