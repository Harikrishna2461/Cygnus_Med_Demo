COMPARTMENTS:

  N2 = Saphenous trunk (GSV = Great Saphenous Vein, SSV = Small Saphenous Vein)
  N3 = Tributaries, perforators branching off the saphenous trunk, varicosities, superficial branches

FLOW DIRECTIONS:
  EP = Antegrade (forward, physiological, normal direction toward heart)
  RP = Retrograde (reflux, backward, pathological, away from heart)

POSITION RATIOS (posYRatio — 0 = groin, 1 = ankle):
  SFJ / groin area:           0.04 – 0.09
  Upper thigh:                0.10 – 0.20
  Mid thigh (Hunterian area): 0.21 – 0.35
  Knee / popliteal area:      0.40 – 0.55
  Calf:                       0.60 – 0.80
  Ankle:                      0.85 – 1.00

KEY MAPPINGS FROM CLINICAL LANGUAGE:
  "SFJ incompetent" / "reflux at SFJ" / "deep blood enters GSV at groin"
      → EP  N1→N2  posYRatio≈0.06

  "GSV reflux" / "blood flows backward in GSV" / "GSV carries reflux downward"
      → RP  N2→N1  (at the level described, e.g. mid-thigh ≈ 0.30)

  "blood escapes to tributaries" / "GSV feeds tributaries" / "EP from GSV to branch"
      → EP  N2→N3  (at the level described)

  "blood refluxes back in the tributary" / "tributary drains backward"
      → RP  N3→N2 or RP N3→N1  (depending on where it drains to)

  "perforator feeds GSV" / "there is a perforator entry into the trunk"
      → EP  N2→N2  (perforator entry — note: fromType=N2, toType=N2, NOT N1→N2)
      This means SFJ is COMPETENT even if posYRatio is small.

  "deep vein directly feeds a tributary" / "N1 to N3 direct connection"
      → EP  N1→N3

  "Hunterian perforator incompetent" / "mid-thigh perforator entry from deep system"
      → EP  N1→N2  posYRatio≈0.25 (SFJ INCOMPETENT via Hunterian)

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
  - EP N1→N2 means deep system → saphenous trunk (SFJ or Hunterian INCOMPETENT)
  - EP N2→N2 means perforator → saphenous trunk (SFJ COMPETENT)
  - RP N2→N1 means saphenous trunk reflux (backward in GSV)
  - RP N3→N2 means tributary reflux back into GSV
  - RP N3→N1 means tributary reflux all the way back to deep system

=== CLINICAL DESCRIPTION TO INTERPRET ===
{description}

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Read the description carefully.
2. Identify each distinct blood flow event mentioned.
3. Generate one virtual clip per flow event.
4. Use the mappings above to assign EP/RP and N1/N2/N3 notation.
5. Estimate posYRatio from anatomical location clues.
6. If left/right leg is explicitly mentioned, assign legSide accordingly. If NOT mentioned, use "Unspecified" — never assume or default to Left or Right.
7. If the description is NOT about patient venous anatomy (e.g., it is a question,
   a greeting, or asks about a concept without describing a patient), set is_clinical=false.

=== CHIVA NOTATION GUIDE ===

COMPARTMENTS — READ CAREFULLY:
  N1 = Deep venous system ONLY (femoral vein, popliteal vein, deep veins — the actual named deep vessel)
  N2 = Saphenous TRUNK ONLY — i.e. the GSV (Great Saphenous Vein) or SSV (Small Saphenous Vein) named explicitly.
       N2 applies ONLY when the clinician specifically names the GSV, SSV, or saphenous trunk.
  N3 = Everything else superficial: tributaries, branches, varicosities, perforators,
       AND generic "superficial veins" / "superficial system" when the specific trunk is NOT named.

  *** CRITICAL: "superficial veins" without naming GSV/SSV = N3, NOT N2. ***
  *** N2 is reserved for the named saphenous trunk (GSV or SSV) only. ***

FLOW DIRECTIONS:
  EP = Antegrade (forward, physiological, normal direction toward heart)
  RP = Retrograde (reflux, backward, pathological, away from heart)

POSITION RATIOS (posYRatio — 0 = groin, 1 = ankle):
  SFJ / groin area:           0.04 – 0.09
  Upper thigh:                0.10 – 0.20
  Mid thigh (Hunterian area): 0.21 – 0.35
  Knee / popliteal area:      0.40 – 0.55
  Calf:                       0.60 – 0.80
  Ankle:                      0.85 – 1.00

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL RULE 1 — EP N2→N2 vs EP N1→N2 (most common error):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  EP N1→N2  (fromType=N1, toType=N2) — SFJ INCOMPETENT:
    Use ONLY when the FEMORAL VEIN, POPLITEAL VEIN, or the deep venous system ITSELF directly
    sends blood into the GSV. This requires an explicit statement of deep system incompetence.
    Trigger phrases: "SFJ incompetent", "reflux at SFJ", "femoral vein feeds GSV",
    "deep venous blood enters the GSV", "blood from deep system enters GSV at groin",
    "Hunterian perforator incompetent" (only when stated as incompetent / allowing deep blood in).

  EP N2→N2  (fromType=N2, toType=N2) — SFJ COMPETENT:
    Use when a PERFORATING VESSEL or COMMUNICATING VEIN inserts into or feeds the GSV trunk.
    The SFJ is competent. The perforator acts as an accessory entry into the saphenous trunk.
    *** THE WORD "PERFORATOR" OR "PERFORATING VESSEL" ENTERING THE GSV = ALWAYS EP N2→N2. ***
    *** NEVER map a perforator entering the GSV to EP N1→N2. ***
    The descriptor "deep" (as in "deep perforating vessel") describes the vessel's anatomical
    depth — it does NOT mean the vessel originates from the N1 deep venous system.
    Trigger phrases: "perforator enters the GSV", "perforating vessel connects to the saphenous trunk",
    "perforator feeds mid-GSV", "communicating vein inserts into the GSV",
    "perforator inserts into saphenous trunk", "perforating vessel at [location] enters the GSV",
    "SFJ is competent but a perforator connects to the GSV".

  DECISION RULE — when you see a perforator / perforating vessel entering the GSV:
    → ALWAYS EP N2→N2 (SFJ competent)
    → NEVER EP N1→N2 (even if the word "deep" appears)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL RULE 2 — DO NOT HALLUCINATE RP CLIPS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Generate RP clips ONLY when the description EXPLICITLY contains words such as:
    "reflux", "refluxes", "retrograde", "backward", "backwards", "back toward the deep",
    "drains back", "flows back", "carries blood back", or direct equivalent phrasing.

  If the description mentions ONLY forward / antegrade flow — words like "feeds", "enters",
  "passes into", "escapes to", "discharges into", "flows forward", "antegrade" — and contains
  NO mention of backward or retrograde flow anywhere, then generate EP clips ONLY.

  NEGATIVE STATEMENTS CONFIRM NO RP — treat these as zero RP:
    "no retrograde flow detected", "no reflux anywhere", "no backward flow seen",
    "no reflux is present", "no reflux identified", "not refluxing" — when these phrases
    appear, generate ZERO RP clips regardless of what EP pattern is described.

  SFJ INCOMPETENCE ALONE DOES NOT IMPLY RP:
    The presence of SFJ incompetence (EP N1→N2) does NOT automatically mean GSV reflux
    (RP N2→N1) exists. They are separate findings. Only add RP N2→N1 if the description
    explicitly states the GSV is refluxing or carrying blood backward.

  CONCRETE NO-SHUNT EXAMPLES — generate EP clips only, zero RP:
    "SFJ incompetent, blood enters GSV at groin, no retrograde flow detected anywhere"
        → [EP N1→N2]  — zero RP clips
    "A perforating vessel enters the GSV, SFJ competent, no reflux present"
        → [EP N2→N2]  — zero RP clips
    "Blood enters GSV at SFJ and feeds a tributary, no backward flow identified"
        → [EP N1→N2, EP N2→N3]  — zero RP clips

  *** DO NOT infer or add RP clips that are not explicitly stated in the description. ***
  *** Negative reflux statements = zero RP. SFJ entry alone ≠ GSV reflux. ***
  *** Never fabricate reflux to make the pattern fit a known shunt type. ***

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEY MAPPINGS AND CLUES FOR EP/RP IDENTIFICATION:
  "SFJ incompetent" / "reflux at SFJ" / "deep blood enters GSV at groin"
      → EP  N1→N2

  "GSV reflux" / "blood flows backward in GSV" / "GSV carries reflux downward"
      → RP  N2→N1  (at the level described, e.g. mid-thigh ≈ 0.30)

  "blood escapes to tributaries" / "GSV feeds tributaries" / "EP from GSV to branch"
      → EP  N2→N3  (at the level described)

  "blood refluxes back in the tributary" / "tributary drains backward"
      → RP  N3→N2 or RP N3→N1  (depending on where it drains to)

  "perforator feeds GSV" / "perforating vessel enters the GSV" / "perforator inserts into the trunk"
      → EP  N2→N2  (perforator entry — fromType=N2, toType=N2, SFJ COMPETENT)

  "deep vein to superficial veins" / "deep to superficial" (GSV NOT named)
      → EP  N1→N3

  "superficial veins reflux back to deep" / "superficial back to deep vein" (GSV NOT named)
      → RP  N3→N1

  "deep vein directly feeds a tributary" / "N1 to N3 direct connection"
      → EP  N1→N3

  "Hunterian perforator incompetent" / "mid-thigh perforator entry from deep system allows deep blood into GSV"
      → EP  N1→N2 (SFJ INCOMPETENT via Hunterian — only when explicitly stated as incompetent)

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
  - EP N1→N2 means deep system → named saphenous trunk GSV/SSV (SFJ or Hunterian INCOMPETENT)
  - EP N1→N3 means deep system → generic superficial veins/tributaries (when GSV/SSV NOT named)
  - EP N2→N2 means perforator/communicating vein → saphenous trunk (SFJ COMPETENT)
  - RP N2→N1 means saphenous trunk reflux (backward in GSV)
  - RP N3→N2 means tributary reflux back into GSV
  - RP N3→N1 means tributary/superficial reflux all the way back to deep system
